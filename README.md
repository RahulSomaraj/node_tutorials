First of all we are going to learn about a project where we login to a user 
So here we have to create a user with some credentials and then login to that particular user.
login will require certain authentication for the particular user 
if the user is admin then display a set of pages.
if a user is a normla user then another set of pages.
After the user is logged in we have to logout the user.
